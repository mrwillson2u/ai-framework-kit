# Example: TaskFlow

This is a **completed example** of the AI Framework Kit in action. It shows what the framework documents look like after going through the full discovery process.

## About TaskFlow

**TaskFlow** is a task management app for freelancers with built-in time tracking. This example demonstrates:

- A clear problem statement and user personas
- Well-defined MVP scope with prioritized features
- Modern tech stack decisions (Next.js, Supabase, Vercel)
- Complete data model with PostgreSQL schemas
- API contracts using Supabase/PostgREST conventions
- Documented architectural decisions with rationale

## What to Notice

### 1. Documents Are Interconnected

- PRD features reference API endpoints
- Architecture decisions link to the Decision Log (e.g., "see DEC-001")
- UX personas inform feature prioritization
- Data model matches API contract

### 2. Decisions Are Documented

The Decision Log (`08-Decision-Log.md`) captures *why* choices were made, not just *what* was chosen. This is invaluable when revisiting the project later.

### 3. Appropriate Detail Level

- Concept doc is high-level (vision, goals)
- PRD has concrete acceptance criteria
- Data model has actual SQL-ready schemas
- Visual guide has specific tokens and values

### 4. Open Questions Are Tracked

Each doc has an "Open Questions" section. Questions get answered and struck through, or deferred with notes.

## Using This Example

1. **Browse the docs** to understand what "complete" looks like
2. **Copy patterns** you find useful into your own projects
3. **Adapt the depth** — your project might need more or less detail
