## Tool-Specific Tips

### Google Stitch
- Works well with detailed feature lists
- Specify "Material Design 3" if you want that style
- Can iterate: "Make the sidebar collapsible" / "Add a floating action button"

### Vercel v0
- Prefers concise, specific prompts
- Good with: "Build a [thing] with [framework] that does [features]"
- Outputs React/Next.js code directly

### Galileo AI
- Excels at full app flows
- Specify user journeys for best results
- Can generate multiple screens at once

### Figma AI / Plugins
- Use the visual style section heavily
- Specify component-level details
- Good for design system generation

### General Tips
- Start broad, then iterate with specific requests
- Reference the style guide for consistency across iterations
- Generate mobile and desktop separately for better results
- Ask for "variations" to explore different approaches

## Exporting Designs

After generating UI designs:

1. **Screenshot/export** the designs you like
2. **Save to** `assets/ui-concepts/` (create if needed)
3. **Reference** in Visual Style Guide and PRD
4. **Note decisions** in Decision Log (e.g., "DEC-005: Chose card-based layout over list view")
